# Face-recognition--Automatic-Attendance-System

This project is a final version of the "Face-recognition-Automatic-Attendance-System" after a few months of trying various face recognition libraries and models. Took very long to implement this and very proud to see the final result very much. It works totally fine and we can connect multiple cameras onto the same program and mark the attendance into a CSV file. To get to this level we used Multithreading in python.
